        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The following introduction tries to explain all the features of GeoLicious.</p>
        
        <h2>Why GeoLicious?</h2>
        <p>GeoLicious was mainly for one reason: I love to be able to look back years later knowing where I've' been everywhere in my life - but I give this information only reluctantly into the hands of any social networks</p>
        <p>As nice as Facebook, Foursquare and Yelp are... the very latest information about my stay, I'd post there only reluctantly. You never know who gets to see it.</p>
        <p>I was therefore looking for an app that I can gather this information privately and present it in a nice way - but such thing did not exist - at least not in the form as I had imagined. And so GeoLicious was born!</p>
        
        <h2 id="intro">General</h2>
        <p>Basically GeoLicious is quite simple. The core of the app is a collection of locations that are linked with check-ins. The whole can be enriched with some information and presented and searched in accordance later. Gradually, the options are to be expanded and extended sense.</p>
        
        <h2 id="map">Map</h2>
        <p>The map is the heart of the application. Here I present to you all the places covered with markers for all check-ins.</p>
        <p>The following things are possible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Via the Check-in button at the top right can be checked in to the current location. Should this location have been registered already, it is being offered directly. If necessary, a new location can be created.</li>
            <li>Found on the top left of the map you can search for new places. GeoLicious uses Apple's own search, which is only available since iOS 6.1. At such places found a new check-in can be made about the placed pin.</li>
            <li>Tap and hold any place on the map to place a new pin that may be used for a checkin.</li>
            <li>A selected pin on the map can be used via the appearing pop to jump into a filtered list of check-ins.</li>
            <li>The two icons at the bottom right and top right of the map allow you to quickly move to the current location or the overview of all places.</li>
            <li>Of course, the card can be arbitrarily enlarged and moved.</li>
            <li>If your locations are shown grouped (see Settings) tapping such a group zooms directly into it.</li>
            <li>If you turn your device sideways the map is displayed slightly larger using more space.</li>
            <li>If desired, the display of the map may be switched to satellite mode. There is an option in the settings.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="checkins">Check-Ins</h2>
        <p>In this area you can see the list of all the check-ins - sorted by their date. You can search and filter the list by tapping and edit individual records.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drag the list down a little to show the search and the grouping options.</li>
            <li>By repeatedly tapping the tab icon for check-ins at the bottom you can jump between the top and bottom of the list back and forth.</li>
            <li>If you tap on one of the entries, you can get access to a filtered list of all the check-ins to the same place.</li>
            <li>From such a filtered list out a new check-in can be created via the top right check-in button.</li>
            <li>By activating the red icon to the right to an entry you will be directed to the details where you can edit it.</li>
            <li>From a pre-filtered list of entries, another tapping leads also to the details of that entry.</li>
            <li>By changing the group setting you can control how the entries are grouped together.</li>
            <li>By the usual wiping gesture you can delete individual entries again.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
        <p>The locations are the collection of all places covered by you. Also, this list You can search and filter by tapping and edit individual entries.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drag the list down a little to show the search and the grouping options.</li>
            <li>By repeatedly tapping the tab icon at the bottom you can jump between to the top and bottom of the list back and forth.</li>
            <li>If you tap one of the entries, you can get access to a filtered list of all check-ins to this location.</li>
            <li>From such a filtered list a new check-in can be created via the top right check-in button.</li>
            <li>By activating the red icon to the right of an entry you will be directed to the details where you can edit it.</li>
            <li>From a pre-filtered list of entries another tapping leads to the details of that entry.</li>
            <li>By changing the group setting you can control how entries are grouped together.</li>
            <li>By the usual wiping gesture you can delete individual entries again.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
        <p>In the settings of GeoLicious I tried to make everything important sufficiently controllable. The app doesn't need many options for now.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can disable the automatic check-in globally if you want to maximize your battery life for some time.</li>
            <li>Notifications for automated checkins and the counter at the app icon may be disabled.</li>
            <li>Short events of less than 3 minutes may be removed again automatically.</li>
            <li>By grouping the markers on the map locations are represented by a summarized icon if they are too close together.</li>
            <li>If you like, you may display the map in satellite mode.</li>
            <li>The app can create as many backups as you like and restore them when needed. In addition, you can secure any and play back these backups through iTunes file sharing.</li>
            <li>This introduction, a list of common questions and answers and a listing of recent changes can be found there as well.</li>
            <li>Via an extra link there you can directly contact me for support. It prepares an email for further processing which is then opened.</li>
            <li>If necessary, you can set back to zero and discard all entries of the entire database. GeoLicious will then create a backup for you, ready for you to restore.</li>
            <li>I have a simple demo data integration, which can be activated here as well. Again a backup is created.</li>
        </ul>
