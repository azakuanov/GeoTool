        <h1>Versions</h1>
        <p>This is a list of relevant recent changes per version.</p>

        <h2>v1.8.6</h2>
        <p>Updated FourSquare credentials.</p>

        <h2>v1.8.5</h2>
        <p>I've made some minor improvements that make GeoLicious more stable
           and reliable.</p>
        <p>I'm happy for (nearly) every review in the AppStore and recommendations to new users. GeoLicious is and will be a hobby and every cent returned motivates me to keep working on it. Thank you.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.8.4</h2>
        <p>There have been some minor optimizations and tweaks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The loading screen is now properly displayed on the iPad too.</li>
            <li>The summary below all lists is back again.</li>
            <li>Handling of automated checkins has been further improved.</li>
            <li>Some things have been optimized for better performance.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>v1.8.3</h2>
        <p>Bugs come and go... unfortunately the app forgot its location if automated check-ins had been disabled. This has been corrected and you may now check in again as used to before.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.8.2</h2>
        <p>This version fixes some minor <b>bugs</b> and improves <b>reliability</b>.</p>
        <p>Furthermore I've successfully <b>removed</b> the <b>limit</b> of 20 locations for automated checkins. From now on you may activate an unlimited number of locations if they are not too close to each other.</p>

        <h2>v1.8.1</h2>
        <p>With the introduction of iCloud Drive with the last update I've noticed some obvious improvements... here they are.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All <b>settings</b> are now <b>stored locally</b> on your device and no longer shared via iCloud synchronization.</li>
            <li>The overall <b>reliability of automated checkins</b> for large databases has been improved by several performance optimizations.</li>
            <li>Manual <b>backups</b> are now <b>labeled with a timestamp</b> rather than an incrementing number.</li>
            <li>The <b>automated check-out</b> of previously entered locations is now performed for the last 5 if possible.</li>
            <li>Fixed some minor bugs related to iCloud Drive updates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm happy for (nearly) every review in the AppStore and recommendations to new users. GeoLicious is and will be a hobby and every cent returned motivates me to keep working on it. Thank you.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.8</h2>
        <p>
            Finally you have the option to store your data in <b>iCloud Drive</b>! This includes the normal database as well as automated and manual backups. This way your data will be automatically stored in the cloud and <b>sync</b> to all your iOS devices. Additionally you will be able to access and save that data on your Mac or via <a href="https://www.iCloud.com/">www.iCloud.com</a>. And of course all that is <b>optional</b>.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore some <b>little things</b> improved...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you've purchased the Pro Version as <b>InApp-Purchase</b>, you can now more easily restore that feature using the settings.</li>
            <li>The list of checkins now names the <b>weekday</b> if you've grouped your entries by day.</li>
            <li>I've fixed some <b>fonts</b> in some dialogs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>v1.7.3</h2>
        <p>I've fixed another bug related to checkins from different timezones on the same day.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.7.2</h2>
        <p>There have been some new bugs that I hope to fix with that update.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using satelite mode for the map should no longer crash GeoLicious.</li>
            <li>Authenticating the app to FourSquare should work again.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>v1.7.1</h2>
        <p>I've made some small changes that make GeoLicious an even better app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Notifications</b> now come with two new options: <b>Discard</b> and <b>CheckOut</b> – right at the lockscreen.</li>
            <li>The <b>icon selector</b> now includes all known icons - even those from Foursquare venues.</li>
            <li>The small indicator <b>icons</b> at checkins now <b>update</b> visibly without scrolling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>v1.7</h2>
        <p>With this version I've switched GeoLicious to an <b>InApp-Puchase</b> for the full version. All former purchases will be <b>upgraded automatically</b> – even if you reinstall on any other iOS device. Who ever downloads GeoLicious for the first time from now on will have <b>10 free entries</b> until the upgrade to the full version is needed.</p>
        <p>I've also tried to add some more features. Here is a complete list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Locations</b> can now get an additional <b>comment</b> too.</li>
            <li>A search for <b>geofence</b> now shows all locations with currently activated auto checkin.</i>
        </ul>
        <p>Further more I still work on support of <b>iCloud</b> for easy sync between your devices and an automated backup of your data. Because of the complexity of changes and related tests I still cannot predict when I'll finally make these changes available.</p>

        <h2>v1.6.3</h2>
        <p>This version includes some <b>preparations</b> for the next major update and tries to <b>fix</b> another minor bug.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.6.2</h2>
        <p><b>Fixed</b> another <b>bug</b> that caused random crashes with new checkins while the map was still updating.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.6.1</h2>
        <p>I've <b>fixed</b> some rare <b>bugs</b>.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.6</h2>
        <p>It has been time for a bigger update of <b>GeoLicious</b>! With the introduction of <b>iOS8</b> some things have changed. I've also implemented some <b>new features</b>, that hopefully are as useful to you as they are to me.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exported <b>databases</b> can now be loaded directly <b>from Email or DropBox</b> into GeoLicious. This allows you to easily share your data with other devices.</li>
            <li>The app now <b>remembers</b> the last visible <b>view</b> and restores it upon a fresh start.</li>
            <li>The map now <b>zooms in</b> to your <b>last visible region</b> with a fresh start of the app – if you wish so.</li>
            <li>New locations via Foursquare now default to your current <b>social settings</b>. Known locations rely on their own settings.</li>
            <li><b>Foursquare icons</b> now will show up properly if you restore a database to a device that did not previously download them.</li>
            <li>GeoLicious has been prepared for <b>iPhone 6</b> and <b>iPhone 6 Plus</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For <b>v1.7</b> I plan the switch to <b>iCloud</b> and therefor real <b>synchronization</b> between different iOS devices. Furthermore I work on <b>waypoints</b>, which connect different checkins on the <b>map</b> and may be placed <b>automatically</b> if desired.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.5.4</h2>
        <p>One more try with another <b>random crash</b> on new checkins... the slower iPhone 4 should be stable now.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.5.3</h2>
        <p>A simple <b>double-tap</b> now toggles the <b>date picker mode</b> between date and time. That makes it much easier to add entries several years in the past.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.5.2</h2>
        <p>The <b>random crash</b> on new checkins has been <b>resolved</b> – finally!</p>
        
        <h2>v1.5.1</h2>
        <p>The last version introduced a <b>small bug</b> where newly added checkins didn't show up as expected – which hopefully has been <b>fixed</b> now. I've also managed to improve the overall <b>performance</b> of large databases.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.5</h2>
        <p>From now on GeoLicious is available as universal app for <b>iPhone</b> and <b>iPad</b>. To benefit from all features your iPad should have an integrated <b>SIM slot</b> and <b>GPS</b> functionality. Otherwise location specific features will be limited in their accuracy.</p>
        <p>I'm no longer able to maintain iOS6 support due to missing hardware and test capabilities. So I've decided to stick to <b>iOS7 only</b>. The upcomming iOS8 will be supported too – that's sure.s</p>
        <p>The following small changes have been made too:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>app icon</b> has been slightly improved with some additional details.</li>
            <li>Editing the date of some checkin now uses an <b>inline date picker</b>.</li>
            <li>You may now search the list of checkins for dates like <b>2013</b>, <b>10/2011</b> or <b>04/25/2010</b>.</li>
            <li>On the iPad the <b>map zooms</b> in to a location, if you select a checkin from one of the lists.</li>
            <li>I've <b>removed landscape mode</b> for the moment – will be added later with new features.</li>
            <li>The <b>footer</b> counting the checkins and locations now counts what is shown.</li>
            <li>Some minor <b>bugs</b> have been fixed.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>v1.4.2</h2>
        <p>GeoLicious should now feel a little faster with large databases.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.4.1</h2>
        <p>I've tried to fix a crash some users reported with checkins to new locations – let me know if it fixes this one for you.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.4</h2>
        <p>There is now a free version called <b>GeoLicious Free</b> you may recommend to those friends who are not sure about the app and willing to test it without risk. The free version allows up to 10 entries and comes with the full functionality of the full version.</p>
        <p>Your data can now be printed using an <b>AirPrint</b> enabled printer. Simply filter all your checkins or locations, group as you prefer and start printing. When you wish to print your checkins you may also choose from some predefined timeranges.</p>
        <p>The following changes have been made to the <b>social networking</b> section:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Now it is possible to switch Foursquare, Facebook and Twitter on or off by using the detailed checkin via the accessory button. This will also respect the comment and use it for Foursquare.</li>
            <li>Every location now remembers not only the Foursquare setting but also whether to link Facebook and Twitter.</li>
            <li>In addition to the active and inactive Foursquare icon you'll now see Facebook or Twitter icons for all checkins and locations, if these options are active.</li>
            <li>A small bug with rare double checkins on Foursquare has been squashed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Furthermore there are these minor additions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GeoLicious now notifies you of inefficiant settings during app start or when activating related features. This includes disabled location services or missing background modes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>v1.3.3</h2>
        <p>At the end of list of all checkins you'll now find a short summary of your data.</p>
        <p>You may now sort the list of checkins in reversed order – new entries will be on top.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.3.2</h2>
        <p>You may now choose one of many different sounds for checkin notifications or turn them off completely – right within the app.</p>

        <h2>v1.3.1</h2>
        <p>I've fixed the automated checkout for the last entry, which has been broken in the last version. Sorry for that.</p>
        <p>If you use the new Foursquare sync you may now also sync these checkins to Facebook or Twitter if you've connected these networks with Foursquare. Otherwise the setting won't have any effect. A direct connection to these networks is not supported yet.</p>
        <p>The link to @GeoLiciousApp now prefers Tweetbot over Twitter over plain web.</p>
        
        <h2>v1.3</h2>
        <p>This version of GeoLicious intruduces an active connection to Foursquare. Those who like may now sync selected locations to the social network. This works for manual checkins as well as automated checkins in the background.</p>
        <p>Of course this functionality is fully optional – you may disconnect Foursquare at every time and reconnect later it desired.</p>
        <p>The following minor changes have been made additionally.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may connect existing locations to Foursquare for later synchronisation. This will also update name and icon.</li>
            <li>The short alert with time since last checkin now respects checkout time if available.</li>
            <li>The icon scroller for locations no longer moves vertically.</li>
